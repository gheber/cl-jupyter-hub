    "## Introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not possible to write a serious piece of code without the use of some kind of *identifiers* or names. Such identifiers are convenient means for the programmer to reference, process and modify data using more or less descriptive names, which represent the data and depend in some way on the context. The standard *modularization* technology encourages the divison of large programs in *modules*. Such modules can be relatively independent of each other, but conversely, they must be able to *communicate*. Most programming languages offer methods for such an organization. For example, the set of identifiers of a module could be divided into two parts, the *private* identifiers, known only inside this module, and the *public* identifiers, known everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this domain as in many others, Common Lisp is by far the most powerful and flexible programming language. At the expense of considerable complexity, Common Lisp's modular technology requires a good grasp of the corresponding *definitions* in the language standard. If the ANSI definition of the language is the only available documentation, these definitions are not easy to understand. An identifier in Lisp is a *symbol* which has a rich internal structure and which has lifetime and visibility during a Lisp session. The modular structure of a Lisp program is defined through the *packaging* system, which allows a programmer to divide a large program into several files, where each file is aware of all the symbols of a certain package, among them the current *default* package, and only the *external* (public) symbols of some other packages. A symbol which is not external in a package is *internal* (private). Also, a package may *import* (that is, \"see\") an arbitrary collection of symbols, internal or external to other packages. In the general spirit of Lisp, the whole structure of such an organization, if necessary, can be modified dynamically, even though this is not usually the best course of action.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, a *mathematical* definition of this system is provided. This should elucidate the process for many a Lisp programmer and enable her to use it more effectively. A basic but *inexact* description of the packaging system is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *package* is a Lisp object in the same way that numbers, lists, and character strings are Lisp objects. In particular, the *type* of a package object is the system class [`package`](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/t_pkg.htm). In Common Lisp, packages are first class citizens, which means they can be the value of a symbol, can be passed as an argument to a function, can be returned by a function, etc.\n",
    "- A *symbol* is a Lisp object whose *type* is the system class [`symbol`](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/t_symbol.htm). The comments made about packages apply for symbols. In particular, a symbol can be the value of another symbol, or even of itself.\n",
    "- Symbols are divided into packages.\n",
    "- At any time during a Lisp session, some package is the *default package* and, as a first approximation, only the symbols of this package are *accessible*. The default package can be modified at any time by the user or a program.\n",
    "- If necessary, there are several methods to access the symbols of packages other than the default package. Conversely, a package may make its symbols more or less easily accessible from the other packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first approximation of the packaging system conveys a general idea of its organization, but general ideas can be deceiving. For example, the idea that the symbols are divided into packages is essentially *false*. More precisely, this divison can be made to appear essential (!), via the so-called home package of a symbol, but it plays only a *minor* role and can be ignored by the programmer risk-free. This notion of a home package is terribly misleading for beginners when they have to design non-trivial packaging structures. In a Lisp environment, one has to deal with two realms, the space of symbols and the space of packages. It is only *inside* of packages that something can be read, which, as an organization, looks a *little* like a division of symbols into packages, but the symbols themselves essentially *ignore* this division. Our subject is to clarify and explain this organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ANSI definition of the packaging system is a *complete* description of this organization, and, in a sense, nothing is missing. However, experience shows that it is easily misunderstood, especially, in non-trivial situations, where it can lead to erroneous programming choices and mysterious bugs. The ANSI definition of packaging is complete and it is the perfect *Reference Manual*. However, for a topic of this complexity a reference guide is not sufficient and a *User Guide* might be useful. And for that matter, an elementary *mathematical* description of the Common Lisp packaging system might help programmers to understand it, and then to use it with greater ease and also to greater effect. In every domain, when precise mathematical language can be employed and is understood, the state-of-affairs improves.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with a review of the ANSI definition of the packaging system while adding in parallel a mathematical description of the main concepts. Finally, we give a complete mathematical definition of this system as a set of mathematical formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main sets of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the packaging system is made of three disjoint sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The set $St$ of *strings*.\n",
    "- The set $P$ of *packages*.\n",
    "- The set $Sm$ of *symbols*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our description of the packaging system, the statuses of these sets are different. Think of the (infinite) set $St$ of *strings* as made of *all* the character strings that *can* be used by a user or a program at any time. Any string can be used at any time, whatever the history of the Lisp session in which we are working may be. In the packaging system, most often, a particular string is used only for a short time, mainly during the read-eval-print loop, when the Lisp reader works. A string is just an intermediary connecting the user and the Lisp session, more precisely the current environment. In contrast, in a given environment, at any time during a Lisp session, some finite set $P$ of *specific* packages is installed in this environment, and also a finite set $Sm$ of *specific* symbols is available. Those packages and symbols can *then* be used, and they are the historical consequence of the current Lisp session. Various Lisp functions allow the user to modify the sets $P$ and $Sm$, and the way they are combined and releated to each other. In other words, consider the set of strings $St$ as constant, vast and independent of the environment, while, on the contrary, the sets $P$ and $Sm$ are restricted, they change during a Lisp session, and they are an essential component of the *current* environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a simple, almost bijective (one-to-one), correspondence between strings and packages, and a convenient place to start our subject. First, at any time during a Lisp session, a *default package* is defined and it can be discovered via the global symbol [`*package*`](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/v_pkg.htm):"

    "The function [`find-symbol`](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_find_s.htm) is analogous to the function `find-package`: given some *name*, a character string, it looks for a symbol with this name. Remember the correspondence between packages and names? A similar correspondence exists between symbols and names, but it's more involved. In particular, a name is *never sufficient* to determine a symbol, a *package* is also necessary. This is why the `find-symbol` function requires *two* arguments, the name of the symbol and the package with respect to which the search is to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of our story, no symbol with the name `\"X\"` existed in the default package `\"COMMON-LISP-USER\"`, and the return value of `find-symbol` is negative, `nil`. (We will explain the second `nil` value in a moment.) Then we pass the Lisp reader the one character expression '`x`'. Lisp evaluates it according to its *read-eval-print* cycle. First, Lisp *reads* the expression and notices that the symbol `x` is used. It examines the current package `\"COMMON-LISP-USER\"`, and does *not* find such a symbol. Before doing anything else, Lisp *allocates* (creates) this symbol, the right terminology being: \"Lisp *interns* a symbol `x` of name `\"X\"` in the package `\"COMMON-LISP-USER\"`.\" To refer to this symbol, the pair made of *its* name `\"X\"` and the (not *its*!!) package `\"COMMON-LISP-USER\"` are necessary, but it would be cumbersome to have to write the expression `(find-symbol \"X\" \"COMMON-LISP-USER\")` every time this symbol is used. To simplify the process of referring to a symbol the designers of Lisp have organized the workspace as follows: if a symbol is read, its character string is capitalized, giving its *name*, and the default package is assumed. In other words, the text `'x'` is roughly  equivalent to the text `(find-symbol \"X\" \"COMMON-LISP-USER\")`. How convenient! ('Roughly', because '`x`' may trigger the allocation of a symbol. In contrast, `find-symbol` never allocates a symbol; but see the function `intern` later.) In the second expression of our example, once Lisp has \"understood\" that the user intends to use the symbol `x`, and observing that such a symbol is not present in the package `\"COMMON-LISP-USER\"`, it allocates a symbol of name `\"X\"` and *interns* it in the package `\"COMMON-LISP-USER\"`. More specifically, a pointer referring to the just allocated symbol is added to the list $InS(p)$ of the internal symbols of the package $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that it is common in Lisp to input the symbols in lowercase letters, and Lisp prints them in uppercase. This might be convenient for distinguishing input from output in an interactive session, but requires some clarification. In particular, there is no difference between the symbols `nil` and `NIL`, whereas the strings `\"nil\"` and `\"NIL\"` are different."

The symbol `NIL` also plays in Lisp the role of the boolean *false*, which creates an ambiguity: if the answer is the symbol `NIL` is that a negative answer or is it a positive answer made of the symbol `NIL`? The ambiguity is resolved by the *second* return value. In the first case, the second `NIL` *confirms* that the first `NIL` is to be interpreted as the boolean *false*. In the second expression, the second return value `:INHERITED`, not a negative, indicates that the symbol `NIL` has been found, and that its *accessibility* via the package `\"COMMON-LISP-USER\"` is *inherited*, a point to be explained later. In other words, the function `find-symbol` returns a genuine symbol *and* its accessibility via the package argument, or a pair of `nil`'s if no symbol is found.

Therefore the *eval* step of the *read-eval-print* cycle generates an error, terminating the cycle with an informative error message.

    "Now we attack the heart of our subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fact 1:** A package $p\\in P$ maintains four fundamental lists:\n",
    "- A list $InS(p)$ of its internal symbols.\n",
    "- A list $ExS(p)$ of its external symbols.\n",
    "- A list $ShgS(p)$ of its shadowing symbols.\n",
    "- A list $U(p)$ of its used packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first important fact toward understanding the subject is this: the first three lists are lists of *symbols* or, more precisely, lists of pointers (machine addresses) aimed at the symbols. Every symbol has a *unique* \"existence\": a symbol is a unique machine object in the environment, but *several* packages may *see* the same symbol, that is, include the machine address of this symbol. In particular these lists are not lists of symbol names (strings). There is another mechanism that allows Lisp to reach a symbol given its name. Every symbol can be accessed directly via a suitable package, and several packages can in general play this role for the same symbol at a given moment in a Lisp session. For example, all the [standard Lisp symbols](http://clhs.lisp.se/Front/X_Symbol.htm) in the `\"COMMON-LISP\"` package typically are accessible via any package.\n",
    "\n",
    "No duplicate symbol (more precisely, no duplicate pointer) is to be found in each of these lists. Also the relations $InS(p)\\cap ExS(p)=\\emptyset$ and $ShgS(p)\\subset InS(p)\\cup ExS(p)$ must be satisfied, for reasons to be studied later.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fact 2:** Given the current set of packages, assumed *coherent*, and given the current state of all the fundamental lists of these packages, the function `find-symbol` can unambiguously determine *whether* a symbol of a given name (some string) is *accessible* via some package; if so, this symbol is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of the package argument of `find-symbol` could make the reader believe the function `symbol-package` will be useful for various tests. This is not the case: All this function returns is the \"birth place\" of the symbol, technically called its *home package*, which says almost nothing about the current status of this symbol with respect to any package. All it says is that at least it is *interned* in this package. In particular, a symbol can be accessible via several packages, possibly different from its home package.

The value (`T`) of the last expression *proves* that both symbols, determined by `find-symbol` via different packages, in fact are the same. Fact 2 can be made a little more precise: At any given time during a Lisp session, a set $P$ of packages and a set $Sm$ of symbols are defined. The various lists of symbols $InS(p)$, $ExS(p)$ and $ShgS(p)$, and the list $U(p)$ of packages used by a package $p\\in P$ together define without any ambiguity which symbols are accessible via the package $p$.

The [`defpackage`](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_defpkg.htm) function (a macro) allocates a package of a given name."

    "We start without any `symb5` symbol in `\"P1\"`, which is confirmed by the double negative answer of `find-symbol`. If instead we use the function `intern`, Lisp notices that such a symbol is absent from `\"P1\"` and therefore allocates a symbol of name `\"SYMB5\"` and *interns* it in the package `\"P1\"` as an internal symbol. The second value `nil` is an indicator of the allocation just made. If we repeat the same expression, which is not an error, then Lisp signals that such a symbol is already present and returns its status, which also informs us of its previous presence. A little weird! This definition of the function `intern` guarantees the coherence of the set of internal symbols of packages. A symbol can be allocated only through this function `intern`. It requires two arguments, a string $st$ and a package $p$. In a sense, the function `intern` first calls `(find-symbol st p)` with the same arguments. If a symbol is found it is returned without modification and no allocation of a new symbol takes place, which otherwise would create a name conflict. On the other hand, if a corresponding symbol is not found, it is allocated and interned in the package explicitly or implicitly quoted, and this new symbol certainly does not generate a name conflict. In this way, the uniqueness of the names of internal symbols of a package is enforced. This does not prevent two different symbols of the environment from having the same name, but the packaging system is organized such that they cannot be accessed via the same package."

    "Here we import `symb3` in the package `\"CL-USER\"` before uninterning it from the package `\"P1\"`. The symbol is then accessible via the package `\"CL-USER\"` or via the list `list`. The evaluation of the expression `(eq ...)` proves that both paths lead to the same address. When the first `(import ...)` expression is evaluated, the symbol does have a home package and that it is not changed. When it is uninterned from the package `\"P1\"`, it becomes homeless. Lisp does not take account of the fact it is internal in other packages. In theory, this would allow it to select one of these packages as an \"emergency home\" package, but the choice would be quite arbitrary? Furthermore this would force Lisp to examine the list of all other packages and all their accessible symbols, which would be very expensive! Here, despite the symbol being internal and therefore interned in the package `\"CL-USER\"`, it becomes homeless after evaluating the `(unintern ...)` expression. Finally we import it in the package `\"CL-USER\"`, where, in fact, it is already present. According to the ANSI standard (see the following note), in such a situation, its status remains unchanged. In particular its home package remains `nil`. A little esoteric, huh? Don’t worry: the home package does not have any real role for the Lisp user.\n",

    "We will prove later that if a symbol $sm$ has a home package $p$, then $sm$ is certainly present in $p$, that is, internal or external in this package. The \"converse\" is false: a symbol may be present in several packages $p_1,\\ldots , p_k$ while not having a home package. This might sound a little weird, but you shouldn't lose much sleep over it: except for the internal efficiency of the Lisp interpeter or compiler, the notion of a home-package is almost useless for the programmer.\n",

The following function gives the list of the external symbols of a package."

Along the same lines, the function [`shadowing-import`](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_shdw_i.htm), as clearly indicated in its name, imports a symbol and immediately adds it to the shadowing list, which could resolve a possible name conflict. For example the *different* symbols `p2:symb4` (external in `\"P2\"`) and `p3::symb4` (internal in `\"P3\"`) are in our environment; the package `\"P1\"` uses both packages `\"P2\"` and `\"P3\"`, but `p3::symb4` is internal in `\"P3\"` and therefore not in conflict with `p2::symb4`. Remember also the current default package is `\"P1\"`. A simple importation of `p3::symb4` in `\"P1\"` generates a conflict, while a `shadowing-import` adds the imported symbol to the shadowing list, shadowing the symbol `p2:symb4` and resolving the name conflict."

    "\n",
    "The fundamental lists defined in a package are the source of a relatively extensive terminology, which is detailed now. The set of symbols *present* in a package $p$, denoted by $PrS(p)$, is defined as the union $PrS(p) := InS(p) \\cup ExS(p)$: a symbol is present in a package if it is internal or external in this package. This union is *disjoint*, the intersection $InS(p) \\cap ExS(p)$ must be empty. Also the relation $ShgS(P) \\subset Pr(P)$ is required. A shadowing symbol of the package $p$ must be internal or external in this package, i.e., a shadowing symbol is present.\n",

If $sm'$ is present in $p$ but not shadowing, with $sm'\\neq sm$ and $sn(sm') = sn(sm)$, then a name conflict would be raised, which is forbidden.\n",

A symbol could be simultaneously present in $p$ and external in a package $q$ used by $p$. That is why the the last term, $−PrS(P)$, is necessary to define unambiguously what an inherited symbol is.\n",

In particular, this does not generate a name conflict, because it is the same symbol which is visible in two different packages via the same name, and a symbol has only *one* name! Nevertheless its status *with respect to* $p$ is not inherited. The status of a symbol is so defined deterministically, even if it is present in two interacting packages by one using the other. Of course the same symbol has status external in $q$.\n",

    "This map is by definition surjective; it is injective if two different symbols accessible via $p$ have different names. In this way the function `find-symbol` is free of ambiguity. It searches first in the present symbols, and finally in the external symbols of the used packages. It is not necessary to compute the list of shadowed symbols since a shadow*ing* symbol, which is also a present symbol, is found first. The main purpose of the coherence rule is to prevent users from designing too contorted situations in name scopes, wich are frequently the source of subtle and difficult to find bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several symbols with the same name may coexist in an environment. The most common way to access a symbol consists in using its *name*, but *different* symbols may have the *same* name. In fact, its symbol name is not sufficient to access a symbol, a package must also be specified. This can be the default package, in which case the direct notation without any colons is possible, or the package name can be explicitly used to prefix the symbol name using the one- or two-colon notation. Of course, the symbol so accessed must be defined in a *deterministic* manner. The definition just given says that a *unique* symbol of some name is accessible from some package.\n",

In the last case, when uninterning a shadowing symbol, a name conflict can be generated: it is possible for symbols $sm'\\in ExS(q)$ and $sm''\\in ExS(q')$ to have the same name while being *different* symbols in the respective packages $q$ and $q'$ used by $p$, and that this collision was resolved by the symbol $sm$ shadowing both.

This is the only case where the symbol itself is modified by `unintern`. The same symbol could be external in another package used by $p$, in which case the symbol *remains* accessible via $p$.

The user of an `export` expression asks Lisp to record the symbol $sm$ in $ExS(p).$ This is allowed only if $sm$ is accessible from $p.$ In other words, the `export` function cannot *add* an accessible symbol to $p.$ In view of the rule $InS(p)\\cap ExS(p) = \\emptyset$, if present in $InS(p)$, the symbol $sm$ is also erased from that list. If $sm$ is external in a package $q$ used by $p$, its status in $q$ remains unchanged, but $sm$ is nevertheless added to $ExS(p)$.\n",

If it is desired that $sm$ be accessible via $p'$, it is possible to make it external in $p$ by an `export` expression. Another solution would be to import $sm$ in $p'$, an operation which doesn't involve $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After exporting it, the symbol $sm$ becomes accessible from any package $q$ using $p$, that is, if $p\\in U(q)$. This can generate a name conflict with a possible *different* symbol $sm'$ of the same name, which is present in $q$ or accessible via $q$ in another package $p'\\in U(p)$, that is, if $sm'\\in ExS(p')$. If this happens, the *export* request is rejected.\n",

The symbol is imported (See the function `import`.) and added to the shadowing list $Shg(p)$ of $p$ if not yet present in this list. This addition to the shadowing list solves the possible name conflicts with symbols inherited from packages used by $p.$  It is possible that a *different* symbol *sm'* with the same name was *present* in $p$ beforehand. If so, such a symbol is *uninterned* from $p$, that is, erased from the lists $InS(p)$, $ExS(p)$ and $Shg(p)$.\n",

One cannot resolve such a name conflict by adding $sm'$ to $ShgS(q)$, hoping to give the precedence to the new inherited symbol: shadowing operates in a uni-directional manner, from a using package toward a used package. If one does so by a `shadowing-import` of $sm'$ into $p$, the symbol $sm$ would be coherently uninterned, erased from $PrS(p)$, and in a sense replaced by $sm'$. One can prepare the precedence of $sm$ over $sm'$ before the `use-package` by previously `shadow`ing $sm$ in $p.$ Also Lisp on its own can propose to *unintern* the symbol $sm$ in a *continuable* error in order to resolve such an observed name conflict.\n",

It seems possible that a symbol can appear more than once in $AccS($`\"P1\"`$)$!? This does not seem compatible with the exclusion of duplicates in general in $InS(p)$ and $ExS(p)$, and also the rule $InS(p) \\cap ExS(p) = \\emptyset$. Yes, but a – one !– symbol can be simultaneously in $InS(p)$ and $ExS(q)$ for a package $q$ used by $p$, which is the case here for our symbol `p1::a` = `p2:a`.\n",

    "The evaluation of `(do-symbols (s p) ...)` makes `s` run through all the internal symbols of $p$, then through all the external symbols of $p$, and finally through all the external symbols of $q$ for every package $q$ used by $p$. It happens that our symbol is in $InS($`\"P1\"`$)$ because it was imported there, and also in $ExS($`\"P2\"`$)$ where it was initially defined. Didn't the programmer of `package-internal-symbols` check the status of the symbol, so that the (fake) second symbol should have been rejected? No, not really, and it is interesting to see the path followed by Lisp: only the symbol-name and the examined package are used, so that when Lisp computes `(find-symbol (symbol-name s) package)`, it obtains *the* symbol, in fact the only one in this story, together with its status with respect to the `package` argument. In our case that is the package `\"P1\"` and the symbol's status (with respect to `\"P1\"`) is `:internal`, even if at the same time $s \\in ExS($ `\"P2\"` $)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates some of the hidden traps and pitfalls that one might encounter as a result of different packages seeing the same symbol in various ways.

Nothing of this sort happened here, where *one* symbol is visible by several packages.\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we kept insisting that this function is not really interesting. To be complete, we prove that a symbol $sm \\in PrS($ `(symbol-package ` $sm$ `)` $).$ In other words, if the symbol-package of the symbol $sm$ is $p$, then $sm$ is present in $p$, either internal or external. When a symbol is allocated (necessarily via `intern`), it is in particular interned in the package which is the second argument of `intern` so that it becomes a member of $InS(p)$. It may be exported in this package, which would make it a member of $ExS(p)$, but it remains present. The symbol can be added to $InS(q)$ for other packages $q$ via `import` or `shadowing-import`. It can also then be \"upgraded\" to $ExS(q)$ in those packages, but the membership in the initial package $PrS(p)$ remains unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to change this situation is using `unintern` with the package argument being $p.$ Then the symbol becomes homeless.\n",
    "In turn, this can be changed with `import` and `shadowing-import`, in which case the symbol is interned in a possibly new package, and the story continues along similar lines. Finally, unless a symbol is homeless, it is always present in its home-package.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also shows that, as was mentioned in the introduction, the `symbol-package` qualifier of a symbol does divide the set of *interned* symbols into packages. It is impossible to have two different interned symbols with the same symbol-name and also the same symbol-package, for they would be interned in the same package, with the same name, and then the set of packages would not be *coherent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interned symbol is internal or external in its symbol-package, and certainly visible via this package. However, it may be visible from many other packages, and this information is not stored in the internal representation of the symbol. If it is external, it is accessible via the packages which use its package. The list of these packages can be determined by the standard Lisp function `package-used-by-list`. But a symbol can also be imported by other packages, which in turn may decide to make (the pointer to) this symbol external, and so visible from other packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** Try to define a function `symbol-accessible-from` with one argument, a symbol, that returns the list of all packages where this symbol is accessible.

    "###  Practical uses of the packaging system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the somewhat esoteric technichalities detailed in this tutorial have no direct use in concrete programming. On the other hand, they can help to understand and demystify the behaviour of your Lisp system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly irritating fact exhibited by some systems is the following: When you merely install, not load, a source file in the editor of your Lisp IDE, these systems immediately scan for symbols appearing in these files and intern them in a separate package. Sometimes this is the package indicated in an inital `(in-package \"XXX\")` of the file, or still more inappropriately, the standard `\"CL-USER\"` package, or also the current default package, even if the initial `in-package` references another package. Often this later leads to symbol collisions which are sometimes hard to identify. A developer who meets this kind of mysterious symbol collisions is advised to search first in this direction. In this case, you should make independent micro-experiments to study the actual behavior of your IDE when you install a file in your development environment. Probably in the early days of Lisp, this was done to improve the efficiency, but on modern systems, it is difficult to see compelling reasons to justify such a strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most symbols of a Lisp file in fact are symbols with lexical scope, a scope limited to a small part of the code, typically *inside* a function, a `let` form, a `do` form and so on. These references are converted by the compiler into raw machine addresses, and these symbols have no real life at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important symbols that have a real life at runtime are those that name functions, those defined through a `defun` form and the like. If a large program is divided in several files, then some decisions must be taken about the status of such a symbol.\n",

    "Usually, a correspondance \"file $\\leftrightarrow$ package\" is maintained. Several Lisp systems require that a file begins with an appropriate `(in-package ...)` expression, declaring that all the symbols used in this file are to be understood as present in this package, except when something else is a consequence of decisions taken outside this file or even in this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ANSI definition of [`in-package`](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_in_pkg.htm), the referenced package must already exist in the environment. Beginning a file by:\n",
    "```cl\n",
    "(defpackage \"MY-PACKAGE\")\n",
    "(in-package \"MY-PACKAGE\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "is tempting but does not obey the requirement about the first instruction of a file being the appropriate `(in-package ...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to have a separate file in the project which is called aptly `packages.lisp` and which contains all the necessary `(defpackage ...)` expressions for the project. The `defpackage` form is flexible and can contain also all the main information about a package, in particular the list of its external symbols and its used packages. (See the ANSI definition of [`defpackage`](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_defpkg.htm#defpackage).) This file is a good foundation for structuring the \"public\" documentation, explaining the role of these packages and their external symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the same lines, it might be worthwhile to have an `\"EXTERNAL\"` package which contains all the external symbols of the application. In this way, the other packages may use this package systematically, giving to this package a status similar to the status of the `\"COMMON-LISP\"` package. This does not prevent another package to import some symbols of other packages, symbols whose role is too specific to justify to make them \"globally\" external.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways for the developer to shorten the Lisp expressions dealing with the packaging system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be rigorous in our explanations and close to the deep structure of Lisp, in this turorial, we used a string identifier everywhere for a package. A symbol could be used instead, its name then being used as the intended string. For example, `(defpackage :my-package)` is equivalent to `(defpackage \"MY-PACKAGE\")`, for the name of the keyword `:my-package` is used, and because of the capitalization rule of the symbols applied by the Lisp reader. The name of `:my-package` is `\"MY-PACKAGE\"`, which through the `defpackage` expression becomes a package-name by following the standard rule which asks for an uppercase name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, each time a package argument is needed, frequently the second one, it can be omitted if this package is the current default package, which justifies this terminology. When using these shortcuts, do not forget about maintaining maximum readability of the source code!"
